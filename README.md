## Document Rules

### Whitespace

Whitespace should be created by the spacing before and after a line, based on the style of text being used. Carriage returns should **NOT** be used to create whitespace, as when the document's text changes, often that whitespace needs to be removed and no longer makes sense.

### Orphans

When a paragraph or table needs to span multiple pages, ensure that there is at least more than one sentence or table row on each page. Leaving orphaned lines creates a disjointed experience for readers.

Example: Don't do this...
```
Heirloom vegan gentrify succulents. Disrupt DIY vexillologist, quinoa next level vinyl la
croix franzen selfies offal bushwick tilde organic helvetica occupy. Affogato street art
ethical copper mug craft beer adaptogen whatever lumbersexual tote bag leggings green juice
selvage williamsburg master cleanse microdosing. Blog iPhone banh mi waistcoat forage health
goth normcore vexillologist activated charcoal, kinfolk master cleanse craft beer fashion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------(page break)
axe quinoa freegan.
```
This is bad.

### Lists

#### List Symbols

Ordered lists numbers will be followed by a period `.` and a `tab`. Unorderd lists will use the round bullet point `•` and a `tab`. Child ordered list items will use a sub point of their parent number followed by a period `.` and a `tab` while child unordered list items will use the same round bullet point `•` and a `tab`.

```
1.  This is line one
    1.1.  This is sub line one
    1.2.  This is sub line two
2.  This is line two
3.  This is line three

.   This is a point
.   This is another point
    .   Child point
```

#### Single Line

Single line lists will end with a semi-colon `;`, except for the final item, which will end with a period `.`.

```
1.  This is line one;
    1.1.  This is sub line one;
    1.2.  This is sub line two;
2.  This is line two;
3.  This is line three.
```

#### Multi-Line Lists

Lists with multi-line items will end with a period `.`.

```
1.  This is line one. It is a good line.
    1.1.  This is sub line one. It is a good line.
    1.2.  This is sub line two. It is a great line.
2.  This is line two. Wow, good line.
3.  This is line three. This is great.
```

>_The irony that this document does not follow these rules is not lost on the author, but it was written in markdown so it doesn't have the fancy Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign features._

### Contact Numbers

Phone &amp; fax numbers will be styled using parenthesis around the area code, and a single space between all other blocks of numbers.

```
(204) 594 1140
```

### Email Addresses

Email address will be styled using all lowercase letters.

```
jsmith@voltagepower.ca
```

## Logos

Always use a png type image as this allows for background transparency. For smaller use cases where a full logo is not appropriate, consider using a thumbnail of the logo without words.
